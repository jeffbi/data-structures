# Linked List
The Linked List is a linear data structure that consists of a series of _nodes_ that contain the data and which are _linked_ together.

For more detailed information see the [article](doc/linkedlist.pdf) in the `doc` directory.

## Implementations
Implementations of the linked list are presented here in C and in C++. These implementations are provided for educational purposes and are not tuned for production code.

The C implementations are simple, low-level implementations that operate directly with the linked list nodes. No additional abstraction layer is provided, and the code size is fairly small.

The C++ implementations are slightly larger and more complex than the C implementation. They provide classes which abstract away the lower-level operations and utilize templates to allow the list to be used with any data type.
