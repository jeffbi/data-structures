# Linked List Implementation in C++
This directory contains an implementation of the Linked List data structure in the C++ language. There is an implementation of a singly-linked list and a doubly-linked list.

These are header-only implementations. The entirety of the Linked List code is in the `SingleLinkedList.h` and `DoubleLinkedList.h` files.

## Educational purposes only
The code presented here is for educational purposes only. The C++ standard library contains the `forward_list` and `list` classes which provide complete implementations of singly and doubly linked list respectively, that have been thoroughly tested and optimized for performance.
